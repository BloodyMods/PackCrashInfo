#Pack Crash Info
Adds a bit of Information about the current modpack to the crashlog:

- Modpack Name
- Modpack Version
- Modpack Author

These information are first gathered from the `manifest.json` then from the `minecraftinstance.json` or as a fallback from the config in `config/bloodymods/packcrashinfo.cfg`
